--- REV A ---

If you have a Rev A board, you will find that there is a glaring bug: I've connected VSS
(ground) to DO and DAT0 to nothing!

To fix:

* Cut the trace to pin 6 on the SD card slot just below C1.
* Run a wire from pin 6 on the SD card slot to GND (use the pad on C1)
* Run a wire from pin 7 to the via just below C1. 

see `bodge-reva.png` for the fix graphically.
